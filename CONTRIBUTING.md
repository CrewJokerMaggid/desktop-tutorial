# ü§ù Contributing to CrewJoker

CrewJoker is a collaborative, open-source project aimed at developing and refining a prompt-based logic system. We welcome contributions from all! Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

---

## üí° How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Start by forking the repository. This will give you your own copy of the CrewJoker project where you can freely make changes.

### 2. **Clone Your Fork**

Clone your forked version to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crewjoker.git
cd crewjoker
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

We use feature branches to keep changes organized. Create a branch for the new feature or bug fix you're working on:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### 4. **Make Your Changes**

Make your changes to the code, content, or documentation. Be sure to test your changes locally before committing.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

Write a descriptive commit message about the changes you‚Äôve made. Be clear about what has been done and why:

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature or fix for issue #X"
```

### 6. **Push Your Changes**

Push the branch with your changes back to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

### 7. **Open a Pull Request**

Once your changes are ready, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch of CrewJoker. Be sure to include:

- A clear description of the changes.
- Any relevant issue number (e.g., "Fixes #5").
