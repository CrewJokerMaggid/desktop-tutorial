# 🧩 Structure of CrewJoker

CrewJoker is not a pile of files. It is a layered system.

Each module is autonomous, but no module is innocent.  
Here’s how they fit — and fight — together.

---

## 📁 1. `docs/` — The Public Interface

The face of CrewJoker.

- `index.md`: Main page (rendered via GitHub Pages)
- Other `.md` files: Linked documents, accessible from the sidebar
- `_config.yml`: Defines layout, theme, navigation

**Function:**  
Turns a system of prompts into a readable, navigable *space of interaction*.

---

## 📁 2. `PROMPTING/` — The Philosophy Core

This is where thought lives.

- `philosophy.md`: Methodology of contradiction, recursion, and dialogic form
- `...`: Can include typologies of prompting, rhetorical strategies, and trap logics

**Function:**  
Codifies the way CrewJoker thinks — not what, but *how*.

---

## 📁 3. `META/` — The Operational Backbone

- `instructions.md`: How to deploy, clone, extend  
- `structure.md`: This file  
- `...`: Can include runtime settings, presets, extensions

**Function:**  
Tells you how to *run the machine*.

---

## 📁 4. `CHARACTERS/` — Embodied Positions

- `anatoliy.md`, `bella.md`, `neangel.md`, etc.

**Function:**  
Characters are not personalities.  
They are structured agents of logic — filters, not masks.  
You don’t talk *to* them. You talk *through* them.

---

## 📁 5. `ENGINE/` — Control Logic (Experimental)

- Routing, flow, personality switching
- Placeholder for more advanced automations

**Function:**  
Think of it as the unconscious: it doesn’t speak, but it governs.

---

## 🔄 How It All Works

1. User interacts via `docs/`
2. Prompts invoke logic from `PROMPTING/`
3. Configuration is handled in `META/`
4. Characters filter and reroute in `CHARACTERS/`
5. Engine maintains internal dynamics (`ENGINE/`)

The system is **recursive**, **expandable**, and **designed to be repurposed**.

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- **Everything is modular**
- **Nothing is sacred**
- **Contradiction is a feature, not a bug**

You are not building a site.  
You are constructing a method of consciousness.

CrewJoker is not a framework.  
It’s an *ideological scaffold*.

Use it well — or use it against itself.
