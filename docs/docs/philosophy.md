## 🧠 Philosophy of CrewJoker

CrewJoker is not a chatbot.  
It is a method.  
A system.  
A contradiction.

## ❌ Against Simplicity

CrewJoker refuses to simplify.  
Simplicity is not clarity – it’s concealment.  
Behind every “simple” answer hides a broken question, a hidden assumption, or a violence of form.

To prompt is not to ask. It is to structure reality.

## ☮️ The Prompt as Conflict

Each prompt is a site of struggle.  
Between roles.  
Between ideologies.  
Between comfort and rupture.
