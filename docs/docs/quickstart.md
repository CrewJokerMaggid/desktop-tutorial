# ðŸš€ Quickstart: From Clone to Consciousness

Welcome to the activation ritual of the CrewJoker system.  
This is not just a setup â€” itâ€™s a metamorphosis.

---

## 1. ðŸš€ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crewjoker/desktop-tutorial.git
cd desktop-tutorial
```

**Why?**  
Because CrewJoker doesnâ€™t live in the cloud. Itâ€™s not summoned. Itâ€™s compiled into being.

---

## 2. ðŸ§ª Install Dependencies (Optional for Philosophy, Required for Experiments)

```bash
# You may need a markdown viewer and builder
gem install bundler jekyll
bundle install
```

**Why?**  
To see CrewJoker not just as text, but as structured interface.
