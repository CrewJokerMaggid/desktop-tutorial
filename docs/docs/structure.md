## ðŸ§­ Structure of CrewJoker

CrewJoker is modular. Each part does one thing â€” and it does it dialectically.

### 1. **PROMPTING/**
> Contains the conceptual logic of your prompting system.
- Philosophy, methods, categories.

### 2. **META/**
> Sets up the operational environment.
- Instructions, runtime configs, startup guides.

### 3. **CHARACTERS/**
> Preset identities for interaction.
- Use them, mutate them, resist them.

### 4. **ENGINE/**
> Control, flow, and conditionals.
- This is the nervous system of your logic tree.

Each folder is a force.  
The structure â€” a field of potential.
