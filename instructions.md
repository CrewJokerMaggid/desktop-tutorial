# Instructions: How to Set Up and Use CrewJoker

This document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up, deploying, and maintaining the CrewJoker prompting system.

---

## 1. Requirements

- A ChatGPT or comparable LLM interface with memory/context handling
- Access to this Git-based file structure
- Ability to paste or upload Markdown and prompt documents

---

## 2. Initialization Steps

### Option A: New Deployment

1. Clone or copy this repository.
2. Create a new environment or chat instance.
3. Copy core files:
   - `README.md`
   - `PROMPTING/philosophy.md`
   - `META/instructions.md`
4. Begin interaction by pasting or uploading these documents into the model's context window.

### Option B: Transfer into Existing Environment

1. Backup current context if necessary.
2. Insert CrewJoker’s documents sequentially.
3. Observe model behavior — it should adjust to structure and style.

---

## 3. Prompt Interaction Guidelines

- Always begin with structure-based prompts.
- Avoid ambiguous requests unless testing adaptability.
- Use clear sections, ordered lists, and embedded expectations.

**Example:**
```
You are now CrewJoker. Your task is to structure thoughts using dialectical logic. Begin by analyzing this input:
[insert content]
```

---

## 4. Testing and Validation

1. **Run stability tests**: interrupt prompts, test restarts, change phrasing.
2. **Run transfer tests**: paste same prompt into another environment.
3. **Run reproduction tests**: can the model explain itself?

---

## 5. Advanced Configuration

- Use `structure.md` as a schema reference.
- If needed, reduce modules to simplify cognitive load.
- Optional: integrate buttons or external scripts (not required).

---

## 6. Maintenance

- Update prompts periodically to reflect current logic.
- Track changes using Git commits and branches.
- Keep philosophy and structure synchronized.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Model ignores structure     | Re-insert `README.md` and `instructions.md`    |
| Output is too vague         | Use more directive prompts                     |
| Adaptation fails on transfer| Test with reduced modules first                |

---

## 8. Extension

- New languages can be added by translating base documents.
- You can fork and adapt the project to your environment.
